                    <p>Project X is a surreal adventure where you play as a scientist pulled into a strange dimension
                        after a particle accelerator accident. Trapped in a vast void of floating debris, you must leap
                        between rocks to reach a portal. It leads to an old, abandoned library haunted by a creature
                        that hunts you relentlessly. As you explore, youâ€™ll need to stay alert, hide when needed, and
                        navigate the maze-like rooms to escape without being caught.</p>

                    <h2>New Experience</h2>
                    <p>Working on Project X was a great experience for me, especially since it was my first 3D project.
                        I learned a lot about teamwork, and everything went really smoothly. We managed to pull it all
                        together in just four weeks, which felt pretty fast! It was exciting to see how we all
                        contributed our skills and ideas to create something awesome together.</p>

                    <h2>Player Movement</h2>
                    <p>In Project X, I focused on creating a smooth player movement system. I implemented wall jumps and
                        wall runs to enhance mobility, along with features like coyote time for jumping after leaving a
                        ledge, crouching, running, and jumping. I also fine-tuned the camera effects and slope movement
                        for a more dynamic gameplay experience. It was a fun challenge to make everything feel just
                        right!</p>

                    <h2>Sound Design</h2>
                    <p>In Project X, I took on the sound design, gathering and implementing all the audio elements for the game. I created sound effects for player movement, the monster, jumpscares, and ambient sounds to enhance the atmosphere. This process taught me how crucial sound is for creating an immersive experience, and I loved adding that extra layer of depth to the game!</p>

I honed my skills in teamwork during my first 3D project, where I contributed to the player movement system and handled the sound design. Gathering and implementing sounds for movement, monster encounters, jumpscares, and ambient effects added another layer to our game.
